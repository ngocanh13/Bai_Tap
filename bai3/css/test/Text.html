    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. on her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>,<i>New scientist</i>, and all the other scitific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On the Road</cite>.
    It had been Moll's favourte book since college, and the longer she sposter in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free</p>
    <p>she had spent the last ten yearrs in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets
    of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonuclecic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do</p>
